# RoadToBecomingHackerman
This repository includes writeups of everything that I have done on the road to become a hacker.

I am going to do everything from scratch. This repository will then include writeups that will hopefully be diverse and maybe even serve as walkthroughs. Perhaps I will even do a CTF some day.
Please note however, that while I have a master's degree in computer science, I do not know much about hacking (except maybe cryptology and programming), so this repository is also a way to keep up with what I have learnt throughout the time after my studies ended.

PS. everything in this repository will most likely be VERY verbose, so as to make sure that anyone can follow along, if they want to. This will include scripts and the like.
