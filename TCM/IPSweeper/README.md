This is a small terminal program written in bash, that sweeps a range of IP-addresses (the host part) and pings them.
Note the use of "=" to do a comparison with an empty string, in stead of "==". This is to make sure that it works in zsh as the script was made on Kali Linux with KDE (i.e. the Konsole program was used as a terminal).
