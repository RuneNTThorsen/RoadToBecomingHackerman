This is a very simple and basic port scanner that only scans ports 50-84 both inclusive. A reasonable thing to add further would be to add a main function.
For the more advanced version, I would probably like to use argparse in order to let the scanner be used in more than one way (for example, let the user specify a specific port to be scanned or a specific range of ports). Another thing for the advanced version would be to utilize multithreading.
