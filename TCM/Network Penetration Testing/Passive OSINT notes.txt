Physical/social
------------------
For physical/social passive recon, there are 2 subcategories. One is Location information and one is job information.
Both of these are closely related to social engineering and a lot of all of this information can be found using social media, Google Maps, etc.

Location information pertains to information about a physical location. Information gathering about a physical location can involve
- satellite images
- drone recon
- building layout (including badge readers, break areas, physical security measures, fencing, etc.)

Job information pertains to information about employees. This involves
- Who are the employees? (name, job, title, phone number, manager, etc.)
- picures (badge photos, desk photos, computer photos, etc.)





Web/Host
-----------
Target validation verifies, that a target is indeed owned by the one that an attack is performed against. This can be done using WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecon, etc.

Finding subdomains of a target can be done using simple Google-fu or tools like dig, Nmap, Sublist3r, Bluto, crt.sh, theHarvester, NetCraft etc.

Fingerprinting is more related to the active part of recon, but parts of it is still passive. There are different tools that can be used to do this, such as Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, NetCat, etc.

Databraches can be explored in order to potentially find credentials for a target. HaveIBeenPwned and similar lists are useful for this.
