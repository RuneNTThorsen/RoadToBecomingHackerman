Nikto is a web server scanner.

Doing

    $ nikto -h <URL>

runs a nikto scan against the host of the URL (the "-h" flag is used to specify the host).

The default scan gives the target IP, the target hostname, the target port, some SSL info (including ciphers, certificate issuer, etc.), information about headers and information about potential vulnerabilities.
