Phase 1: Reconnaissance
---------------------------

Passive:
-----------
Passive information gathering is when information is gathered without involving the target itself. E.g. finding stuff on a search engine or social media, etc.
This does not involve scanning or any other sort of interaction with the target itself.
This is essentially OSINT (Open Source INTelligence gathering).

Active:
----------
Active information gathering involves interaction with the target, e.g. scanning, probing, etc. This is related a lot to phase 2.




Phase 2: Scanning & Enumeration
----------------------------------
Once phase 1 is completed, scanning and enumeration can be done using a variety of programs, such as Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, Metasploit, etc.
Enumeration can not be understated at all. A lot of hacking is just enumeration.




Phase 3: Gaining Access
--------------------------
Access is usually gained through some sort of exploit or social engineering.
Which exploit can be utilized depends on the results of phase 2 (you can't use an exploit for a service, if that service is not running on the target).




Phase 4: Maintaining Access
------------------------------
Once access to the target is attained, the access has to be maintained. This makes sure that the attack can be fully developed.
Some of the things to consider here is; what happens if a system is rebooted? How does one make sure not to get detected, in order to not be kicked off the system? And lots more...




Phase 5: Covering Tracks
---------------------------
There is a lot of tools that can be used to cover one's tracks, such that forensics will not later be able to see what has been done to a system.
In general, one does not want to leave things behind (such as malware, etc.).
For pentesting this step is not as important, but for hacking in general it is worth noting.
