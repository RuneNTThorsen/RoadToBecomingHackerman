This week we did a lot of Haaukins exercises. This involved a lot of common Linux commands, Wireshark, Binwalk, Hydra, John, OSINT, etc.

I completed all of the Linux and digital forensics exercises! :D
I also did all of the OSINT exercises, except one :P
Lastly I also did about half of the web exploitation exercises :)
