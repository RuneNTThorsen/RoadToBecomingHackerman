As stated in the challenge, it is surely expected that there will be some crypto challenges.
    This one involves the caesar cipher (read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). There is a text given:
        VJG SWKEM DTQYP HQZ LWORU QXGT VJG NCBA FQI QH ECGUCT CPF AQWT WPKSWG UQNWVKQP KU HJCUTKTDEFEO
    and given the challenge name, it can be inferred that this text is most likely encrypted using the caesar cipher.
    Assuming that it is the english alphabet that is being used to do encryption/decryption and numbers does not count, there are a total of only 25 different possible plaintexts. I made a small python script called "caesar_bruteforcer.py" to solve this challenge. Having Python installed, it is invoked using
        $ python caesar_bruteforcer.py "VJG SWKEM DTQYP HQZ LWORU QXGT VJG NCBA FQI QH ECGUCT CPF AQWT WPKSWG UQNWVKQP KU HJCUTKTDEFEO".
    Actually the ciphertext can be any ciphertext, but is has to be enclosed in quotation marks, if it contains any spaces.
    The script saves the possible plaintexts in a file called "possible plaintexts". Reading this file there is only one possible plaintext, where there is some comprehensible english, so this must be the one. It reads:
        THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG OF CAESAR AND YOUR UNIQUE SOLUTION IS FHASRIRBCDCM
    from which
        FHASRIRBCDCM
    can be extracted and is the password used to solve this challenge.
