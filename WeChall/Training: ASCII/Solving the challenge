ASCII is an encoding of characters into numbers (read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). One cna look up a table to do the encoding or the reverse (see for example here: https://www.asciitable.com/).
    The challenge is to take a sequence of numbers and convert them to their respective characters. The sequence given is
        84, 104, 101, 32, 115, 111, 108, 117, 116, 105, 111, 110, 32, 105, 115, 58, 32, 115, 115, 101, 104, 98, 111, 99, 114, 103, 109, 105, 103.
    The are saved to a file called "encoded_chars" in this folder. I made a python script to decode them and print them to screen. It is called "ASCII_decoder.py" and is used by doing
        $ python ASCII_decoder.py encoded_chars
in the terminal. It prints out:
        The solution is: ssehbocrgmig
so the password used to solve this challenge must then be
        ssehbocrgmig.
